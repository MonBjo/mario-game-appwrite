# Mario Game Appwrite
I follow along with Ania Kub√≥w as she shows us how to make a web game.
[2hrs to code Mario with Auth + save scores | JavaScript, CSS, HTML](https://youtu.be/1CVSI3MZNNg?si=oOwU493Bz5hn1Wsw)

Textures found at:
- [Dino textures](https://arks.itch.io/dino-characters)
- [World textures](https://rottingpixels.itch.io/nature-platformer-tileset)

TODO: *(in no particular order)*
- [x] Finish tutorial
- [ ] Break up the code into different files
- [ ] Change all the textures, font and styling
- [ ] Add animations
- [ ] Add a screen before starting the game
- [ ] Add a restart button on the 'lose' screen
- [ ] Show highscore for all players

BUGS: 
- [ ] The player dies when falling onto an enemy while jumping onto them kills the enemy, as expected
- [ ] The enemies don't fall off the world as expected.

## v.0.4.0
The tutorial by Ania is done. It was very well made and I highly recommend it! I wouldn't say it is a *finished* game but it is definitely a good base and starting point!
